## Steam Status Badge
Steam Status Badge is a project that allows you to share your Steam status and the game you are currently playing by simply using an `<img>` tag within any HTML-readable space.
This makes it easy to display your Steam activity on websites, blogs, forums, and more. 🌐

If you want to share your love for gaming with the world, Steam Status Badge is the way to go! ❤️🎮
